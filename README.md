(in progress, very speculative) A kind of calculus. A kind of infinite dimensional fractal smooth turing-complete manifold of finite kolmogorov-comlexity of, defined entirely by [[map of [map of d_dimensional_length_1_vector] to scalar] aka a bayesNode (or more efficient but lower precision, a neuralnet) of as many dimensions as points on a d dimensional hypersphere (like an infinite dimensional metric-tensor made of sum of infinity smaller metric-tensors of d dimensions at smooth rotations), but in many cases is simpler patterns]. Energy function of the manifold is sum, for all surface points, for all d dimensional d-sphere rotations, energy at that point. Can in theory represent lambda functions as sum of energy of all d! permutations of 3sat constraints of subset isomorphism, or similarly continuously turning a sphere insideout like at https://youtu.be/x7d13SgqUXg?t=427 and approximations of rule110 and conwaysGameOfLife and lambda functions and randomAccessMachine etc and if I ever do pursue this far enough, that should be among the first few testcases, to generate a similar video and beyond. Possibly a better model for many dimensional saddlepoints on eventHorizon between many particles of hawking radiation or quantum foam or of more precisely predicting the colors of light emitted from molecules at rest or while falling into a blackhole or during baryogenesis, but theres simpler things to try first.
