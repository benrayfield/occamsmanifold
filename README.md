(in progress, very speculative) A kind of calculus. Smooth infinite dimensional turing-complete manifold whose energy is sum of [map of [map of d_dimensional_length_1_vector to scalar] to scalar] dotprod d-sphere surface of densities in those directions, at each point. and at all d-sphere rotations at point for finite d dimensions in infinity dimensions.

The plan to create a very basic prototype of some kind of vibrating manifold is to use LazyCL (after I get that working) for number crunching and to get about 1 teraflop/sec on my local GPU by choosing many random sparse points on the manifold, including many points near them, and sending those into the GPU cores which will each hold a copy of a very small neuralnet (which can be used as a simple kind of [[map of [map of d_dimensional_length_1_vector to scalar] to scalar] function) and within each GPU core, do many random rotations of it (like graph subset isomorphisms but smooth) and adjust the curve/density/etc gradually that way at many points at once. Its compute bottlenecked instead of IO bottlenecked so should run faster than matrix multiply and be able to vibrate and play with the manifold in realtime on screen like dragging it with all 10 fingers on a phone browsers multitouchscreen (to server with the GPU at it) or a mouse. Due to it being a very expensive calculation to simulate alot of dimensions (or even sparse dimensions) at once, it will be low precision and fewer dimensions, but as it is a sparse dimensional system I might eventually figure out a way to simulate as many dimensions as lambda functions.

A kind of infinite dimensional fractal (like a more advanced kind of taylor-series defining energy function at a single point defines the whole manifold, except infinitely more automorphic) smooth turing-complete manifold of finite kolmogorov-comlexity of, defined entirely by [[map of [map of d_dimensional_length_1_vector to scalar] to scalar] aka a bayesNode (or more efficient but lower precision, a neuralnet) of as many dimensions as points on a d dimensional hypersphere (like an infinite dimensional metric-tensor made of sum of infinity smaller metric-tensors of d dimensions at smooth rotations), but in many cases is simpler patterns]. Similar to graph-coloring but smoothly, energy function of the manifold is sum, for all surface points, for all d dimensional d-sphere rotations, energy at that point. Can in theory represent lambda functions as sum of energy (trying toward the AND of all possible permutations and subsets, but smoothly allowing to differ) of all d! permutations of (d * (d-1) / 2)-sat constraints of bit edges between subset isomorphism of nodes with countNodes * (countNodes-1) / 2 number of edges (but smoothness is the main use of it), or similarly continuously turning a sphere insideout like at https://youtu.be/x7d13SgqUXg?t=427 and approximations of rule110 and conwaysGameOfLife and lambda functions and randomAccessMachine etc and if I ever do pursue this far enough, that should be among the first few testcases, to generate a similar video and beyond. Possibly a better model for many dimensional saddlepoints on eventHorizon between many particles of hawking radiation or quantum foam or of more precisely predicting the colors of light emitted from molecules at rest or while falling into a blackhole or during baryogenesis or in space-time-crystals or very cold things or in room temperature things influenced by vibrating electric plasma controlled by FPGA chips such as to attempt the formation of a 3d quantum dot cellular automata to perform 3d matrix multiply. In theory can approximate all existing kinds of calculus and models of computing and manifolds (including zeta and stokes and fractional fourier and mach plus minus epsilon, especially smooth manifolds at mach = exactly 1 in theory near silent and costing epsilon energy (and in practice (see my jsoundcard sample code) I can pick up a whisper from across the room from a microphone thats closer to the speaker than your mouth and amplifying both of them thru a laggy system), and by mach I mean of sound, of light, of the 60 hz in a usa electric outlet, or whatever the resonance), and I might go so far as to speculate that all of reality exists only at mach 1. but theres simpler things to try first.
