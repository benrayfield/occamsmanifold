(in progress, very speculative) A kind of calculus. A kind of infinite dimensional fractal smooth turing-complete manifold of finite kolmogorov-comlexity of, defined entirely by [[map of [map of d_dimensional_length_1_vector] to scalar] aka a bayesNode (or more efficient but lower precision, a neuralnet) of as many dimensions as points on a d dimensional hypersphere (like an infinite dimensional metric-tensor made of sum of infinity smaller metric-tensors of d dimensions at smooth rotations), but in many cases is simpler patterns]. Energy function of the manifold is sum, for all surface points, for all d dimensional d-sphere rotations, energy at that point. Can in theory represent lambda functions as sum of energy of all d! permutations of 3sat constraints of subset isomorphism, or similarly continuously turning a sphere insideout like at https://youtu.be/x7d13SgqUXg?t=427 and approximations of rule110 and conwaysGameOfLife and lambda functions and randomAccessMachine etc and if I ever do pursue this far enough, that should be among the first few testcases, to generate a similar video and beyond. Possibly a better model for many dimensional saddlepoints on eventHorizon between many particles of hawking radiation or quantum foam, but theres simpler things to try first.
